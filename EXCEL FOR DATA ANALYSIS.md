# WEEK 2 - EXCEL formulas and function
Excel formulas and functions are powerful tools that allow users to perform various calculations and operations within spreadsheets. Here are some important concepts and functions you should be aware of:

- **BODMAS:** This stands for Bracket, Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. It is a mathematical rule used to determine the order of operations when evaluating mathematical expressions.

- **Relative and Absolute referencing:** When using formulas in Excel, cell references can be either relative or absolute. A relative reference changes as it is copied or filled, whereas an absolute reference remains constant. Absolute referencing is denoted by a "$" sign before the column and/or row reference.
- **RAND and RANDBETWEEN:** These functions generate random numbers in Excel. RAND produces a random number between 0 and 1, while RANDBETWEEN generates a random integer between a specified range of values.
- **Transpose:** in Excel this means flipping the orientation of data in a table or range of cells, converting the rows of a table into columns, or vice versa.

## Basic functions:
- **SUM:** adds up a range of cells.
- **AVERAGE:** calculates the average of a range of cells.
- **MAX:** finds the highest value in a range.
- **MIN:** finds the lowest value in a range.
- **COUNT:** counts the number of cells in a range that contain numbers.
- **COUNTA:** counts the number of non-empty cells in a range.
- **CONCATENATE:** joins two or more strings together.

## Advanced functions:
- **VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP:** used to search for a value in a table and return a corresponding value from another column or row.
- **INDEX and MATCH:** also used for table lookups.
- **XLOOKUP:** a newer function that can be used as a replacement for VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP.
- **IF:** used for conditional statements.
- **SUMIF:** used for conditional sums.
- **COUNTIF:** used for conditional counts.
- **AVERAGEIF:** used for conditional averages.

## PIVOT TABLES IN EXCEL
Pivot tables are a powerful feature in Excel that allow you to summarize and analyze large amounts of data in a structured and dynamic way. They provide a flexible and interactive way to organize, summarize, and extract insights from your data.

1. **Data Source**: A pivot table requires a data source, which can be an Excel table, a range of cells, or an external data connection. The data should be organized in columns with headers.

2. **Structure**: Pivot tables have a structure with rows, columns, values, and filters. These elements allow you to arrange and analyze your data in various ways.

3. **Row and Column Fields**: You can select one or more columns from your data to be used as row or column fields in the pivot table. These fields determine the structure and grouping of the data in the table.

4. **Value Field**: The value field represents the data that you want to summarize or perform calculations on. It could be a sum, average, count, maximum, minimum, or any other type of calculation.

5. **Filters**: Filters allow you to narrow down the data displayed in the pivot table based on specific criteria. You can apply filters to one or more fields to focus on specific subsets of data.

6. **Dynamic and Interactive**: Pivot tables are dynamic and interactive, meaning you can easily change the arrangement of the data by dragging and dropping fields. You can quickly switch rows and columns, add or remove fields, and modify calculations, providing real-time updates to the results.

7. **Aggregation and Calculation**: Pivot tables automatically aggregate and summarize your data based on the selected fields and calculations. You can perform various calculations on the value field, such as sum, average, count, etc., to gain insights from the data.

8. **Drill-Down**: Pivot tables allow you to drill down into the underlying data. By double-clicking on a cell, you can see the detailed data that makes up that value.

Pivot tables are especially useful when dealing with large datasets and complex data analysis tasks. They enable you to quickly analyze and visualize data from different perspectives, identify patterns, trends, and outliers, and make data-driven decisions more effectively.
